##Project:BAMAZON-MySQL

##Installation
TO DO: I created an Amazon-like storefront with MySQL and Node.js application that takes orders from customers and deplete stock from store's inventory. I have used MAMP as my source of server and MySQL for database.

##Usage
In this project I decided to use cryptocurrecies as my products and the actual costs effective prices from february 2018. I decided to use this instead of actual products you can buy on amazon because I wanted to understand how platforms work for cryptocurrencies and if this was capable of doing what interested me.

##Challenges
As shown in the image, I could not initiate npm without getting error files. I tried to do it on my own my researching online and redownloading and following the steps but still could not get package.json files to work.
